# Mazi

Mazi is an interactive app that encourages individuals to stay in and practice quarentine during this time using the point system of "bits."


## Building Mazi

Mazi is 

## Address 
As part of the registration of a user, address will be included along with name, birthday and contact information. The app locates the address provided and creates a circle of 500 feet radius around the house. In order for the user to collect bits, he/she has to stay inside that radius of distance or else he/she will be considered out of bounds.

## Timer 
Mazi implements a timer into the app to track the amount of time the user stays within the radius of his/her house. Users can choose to select pre-set time periods or a self-timer that records the time live. The timer keeps going unless the user steps out of bounds, in which the timer will stop. If the timer stops, bits are not added onto the user's scoreboard. 

## Bits 
For every hour, Mazi will reward the user with a point in the system of bits. At every bit level, the user can choose between a variety of discounts and/or free awards gifted by the participating companies. The prizes could include discounts, giftcards that can be reedeemed online or for later use, or for food delivery of that company. 

## Companies
Mazi encourages individuals to stay inside with the help of chain restaurants and local companies. The ads for smaller businesses will be included throughout the app to incentivize participation while also gaining advertisement for their business. 

## Display
Mazi will also display recent news, community outreach opportunities, or just-for-fun activities, in addition to advertisements of the company.
